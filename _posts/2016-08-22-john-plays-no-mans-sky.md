### Some people tend to dismiss video games as frivolous and superficial experiences, but by now it should be common knowledge that the industry has produced games that are thought-provoking in so many levels, making players think about the human condition and ask questions they otherwise wouldn't have considered. 

[No Man's Sky][0] is one of those games, and one of my favorite Youtubers, [John Green][1], recorded himself playing the game while asking the viewers some pretty big questions: What constitutes a good and successful life? To what extent should we pursue our curiosities as individuals and as a species?

No matter what your answer may be, it does make you reconsider the conventional answers we tend to hear and give out ourselves.
