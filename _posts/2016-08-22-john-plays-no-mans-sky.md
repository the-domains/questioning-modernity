# What Constitutes a Good Life?

Some people tend to dismiss video games as frivolous and superficial experiences, but by now it should be common knowledge that the industry has produced games that are thought-provoking in so many levels, making players think about the human condition and ask questions they otherwise wouldn't have considered.

[No Man's Sky][0] is one of those games, and one of my favorite Youtubers, [John Green][1], recorded himself playing the game while asking the viewers some pretty big questions: What constitutes a good and successful life? To what extent should we pursue our curiosities as individuals and as a species?

No matter what your answer may be, it does make you reconsider the conventional answers we tend to hear and give out ourselves.
