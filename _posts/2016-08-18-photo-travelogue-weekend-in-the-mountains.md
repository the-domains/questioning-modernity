  I was going through my photos and found these pictures that I took during my
  trip to Yamanashi Prefecture. I took several, but the quality of most was
  questionable, but I picked out these which were my favorites. I recommend you
  look at these pictures as you read through my previous post. I consider it a
  photographic continuation to the ending of that post.

# Yamanashi Travelogue

I was going through my photos and found these pictures that I took during **[my trip][0]** to Yamanashi Prefecture. I took several, but the quality of most was questionable, but I picked out these which were my favorites. I recommend you look at these pictures as you read through my previous post. I consider it a photographic continuation to the ending of that post.
