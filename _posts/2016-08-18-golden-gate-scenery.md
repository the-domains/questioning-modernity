# Golden Gate Scenery

Took these pictures in a cold San Francisco afternoon. You can check out the 500px gallery [here][0]. It was a somber day full of beauty and roaring winds. I also took the opportunity to do an impromptu livestream of the scenery. I enjoyed reading the flurry of comments from people around the globe admiring the view and finding the sound of the waves relaxing. Check out [this link][1].

If you enjoyed these pictures, check out my recent [travel journal post][2] covering one of my most memorable journeys in Japan.
